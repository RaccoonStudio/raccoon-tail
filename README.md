Raccoon's Tail
==============

**Raccoon's Tail** is a small and responsive CSS kickstarter used to easily start any mobile first project.

This kickstarter was created by the [Raccoon Studio](https://raccoon.studio) for its projects.
It was [Sass](https://sass-lang.com) and [Less](http://lesscss.org) ready.

This project wasn't a framework project but just a little kickstarter for your next project.
